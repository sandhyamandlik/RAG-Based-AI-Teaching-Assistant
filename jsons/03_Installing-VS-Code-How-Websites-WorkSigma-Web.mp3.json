  "text": " Today we will start the SIGMA web development course with this video. We will start the SIGMA web development course with high energy.

And with that, you will get exactly the same videos as you will be able to follow. I will go to Google quickly and I will write you download VS code. Now what is this VS code? VS code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux, or any other operating system, You can download VS code for that feature operating system. And you can see exactly the same process as I have downloaded the folder. Here is the VS code. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here and see here. You can install it in the VS code setup. So simply install VS code. The easier you install the game, You can easily get the agreement from here. This lies in upslice. It damages. And then I will accept the agreement and accept it. You can read it as well. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Oh my God. Look at this. Next, next, next. Check both the icons here.

Now I will recommend you to subscribe to this channel. Because these videos, I want you to follow this video. I will also add a notification. If you want to follow this video, You should subscribe. The VS code has been downloaded. I have opened the VS code. Don't be scared. I am telling you again, If you are already coming, We are taking beginner and friendly start here. In initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. I will request you to tell me in the comment section, What is your level? Beginner, Advanced, Intermediate user. Tell me in the comment section, Where is your web development? Beginner, Advanced Intermediate. Please, please, If you do not know the beginner, Let me tell you that VS code is a Editor. You help to edit the code. You can also edit the code in the node pad. Yes, in the node pad, Yes, I am not doing it in the locality. Or I will setup it. I will show you in the video. What is this? It is made from a node pad. Now, let's setup it. I will not use the color theme. I will do it. I will do dark mode. I have done this in the next section. Next section. You can also turn on the welcome. But, there are some tips. That is it. The VS code is already started. You can see the screen of this VS code. You can make new files, new folders. But, I will recommend you to turn it on. Yes, you can turn it on. I am going to make a new folder. And I am going to name it. You can get it right. Sigma Web Development. Of course, what is the course? We will do everything. We will do everything. We will delete the course. If you will do the shift and write the window. You can see here that the option of open with code is called. This option of open with code is called. You can open this particular folder in the VS code. You can select it. Now, what will you do here? You can choose this side trust. You can select this side trust. And, this folder is open. I will click on the plus button. To make a new file. I have written here index.html. Now, I will write it. Enter and then I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. I have written here. You can see that this is the file you have saved. You can save it by clicking on the script. If you want to save it, you can save it. I will recommend you to go to file and enable auto save option. As you type, you will not see this file as you have saved. You will save it instantly. And I will also recommend this. We will not use the control as you want. If you want to save it, you can disable this option. You can choose one thing. You can click on the settings here. And search for mouse. Now, you can see that you will check the editor mouse wheels. Let me tell you what to check. Let me just check and close the settings. Now, you have to be absolutely scared. Why is the VS code? How is the VS code? Why is this? But you can't see it. Now, you can scroll from this way. What happens? Your font size changes. Now, I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. You can see that there is a lot of downloads in the web development course. What happened in the folder name? This file is made in the index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is made here. I will make another file here. I will make this. Let me make this file. What happens? You can see this file is made here. These are the 2 sync files. Open this file from the node pad. And I will show you this file in the node pad. I can do that too. It is my fault. But I will not use the node pad. Because I do not give the node pad in VS code. And I want the features to be found. I don't want to overrun you guys. But I will show you the VS code. What is the VS code that you don't get the node pad? If I write you, I will write HTML. I will enter it. I will give it to you. If I mark the exclamation mark, I will click on the HTML. And then I will click on the HTML. The basic code is here. I will do it again. You guys should not overrun it. But I want to tell you that this is the way we get the VS code. We have not used the node pad. And this is how much the file is getting. It is getting the developer's file. It is getting hacker's file. It is also necessary. I want to comment on Mac and Linux users. I am using the same thing as you. I am using Windows. I have Windows Laptop. I cannot use it in 3 Laptop. I can use the same thing as you. In fact, I want to say that it is similar. It is exactly the same. It is very similar. You guys will follow along. Don't take tension. I will tell you about some extensions. You will also get the extensions. You have also got the extensions. I will comment on what is the thing. I will tell you about it. And this is criminally underrated. I will tell you that it will be fun. I want to tell you that you will do it here. You will do it rightly. You will do it rightly. You will get many options of the VS code. You do not need to know all these options. We will come to the course. The feature that you will come to use. I will tell you all this. I will use it. What I will do right now. I will toggle a screen cast mode. I will not do it. I will tell you. I clicked. I will type something. I will click on the cap slot. I will see which button I will click. This is not the thing for you. But I want to tell you that the screen cast mode. The settings we can change. You can see the screen cast mode. The vertical offset. If I want to do vertical offset. I will go up. I will go up. I will do 60. If I will do 60. I will go up. I will go up. From bottom to top. I have done 0. I will type something. I will do this. I will show you. I will close this text file. I will close the settings tab. For tabs. You can see the tabs. I hope you have understood. I will tell you what is the step by step. You can close the page. I will zoom in. I will record the video. I will record the video. I will add the name and name. I will zoom in. I will record the video. I will try to see the screen. But when I am coding. I will not zoom in. You have to keep in mind. These are related things related to VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. One website is basically 3 types of people. Imagine 3 people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is server? Who is server? Who is bb. Who is bb. Who is bb. Who is server? I am. You will use all of this. It is a Chrome. Hello Chrome. I will show you. I will show you. I will show. I will show you. I will write this browser and copy it to the code with Harry.com website. Or if I write here, I will write here, YouTube.com. I will say, I will give YouTube.com website. I will say, I will give YouTube.com, I want to see YouTube. What is the browser? You want YouTube? Okay, so I will enter here on YouTube.com. So, I have got the server from YouTube.com. You understand? I have got the server from YouTube.com. I have passed it and showed this screen. It has been so fast that my internet.com is very fast. It is so much less than today. But still, my locality is very fast. So, this fast internet speed is very fast. So, the client is sending a request to the server. The client is the same as my assistant. I will do the same thing with the help of the server. I will do this with the help of the server. Who is managing the server? They are managing the server. YouTube.com. And there is a code inside the server. Which sends me this code. I will write here, when I write YouTube.com, this code. How to convert this code into this? This is the browser. I have to show this to the customer. So, the client is saying something like this. I give you a word. The browser says, I give you a word. You should give a word. I ask for a word from YouTube.com. Then the server goes to the server. I give a request to the server. I give a word. The server will give it to the server. Or it will not say anything. Or it will say error. Or it will say that the server error is not found. All the responses should be 200. The response is 200. The response is with the user. The user comes back to the client. I hope you are clear. The client is a server. So, the client is a server. The client is a server. This is how it works. I will tell you a little more about this. When you write Google.com. There is no website. So, the client says, I give Google.com. The browser says, Google.com is a server. So, the server goes to the browser. And Google.com is a server. And you give it to the server. You give it to Google.com. Google.com is a server. All the images, videos, all these things. All these icons. This is the code of these icons. And that also works as a browser. We have displayed the size. So, the server that is a bundle. This is how it works. And pass this bundle. And show it to the server. It works as a browser. Now, the user will do the interaction further. With this page, the server will get an additional request. I will do it right. And then I will go to the network. And here I will write, I will write, I will write, So, there are so many requests for images. And also, there are so many requests. So, just like you will interact. And you will have to send the request to the browser. So, in the end, you can understand it as a restaurant. You have ordered the request. You have ordered the order. Your order has taken a waiter. The waiter went to the kitchen. You sent it in the order. You can understand the kitchen server. And finally, the kitchen has ordered the order. So, what did the waiter do? The worker who is doing the work of the browser. The waiter has given you the order. It can be that he does not know any reason in the order of the kitchen. It is very less. You are ordering something. And you can't get it. But sometimes it happens. Similarly, sometimes it happens. You get an error. For not for error. Or for 500 error. The server does not work. So, the error is called, Whenever you get the error, you will tell people. But ideally, it is the ok response. And you get the same kind of message. So, you can understand it as a restaurant. Whenever you write google.com slash mail, If you write google.com slash mail, You will see it. And if you write code with aeri.com slash contact, You will see the code with aeri.com slash contact. If you write google.com slash mail, You will see the code with aeri.com slash contact. If you write 500 error, You will see the page with a 500. Whatever server you send, you will see it. So, this cycle is going on. The client requests the request. The browser sends the server. After that, the server sent the server. The browser sent the data. And whoever sent the data, The browser showed the client. After that, the client did something. The browser sent the server to the same request. Then the server sent something. The server sent the data. The client gets the return of the browser. And so on. So, you guys, Ok, this is all right. But what is the background? What does it mean? The background is. The server's request is being processed. If you all agree, You have a blog. Block has a lot of data So what will you do? You will store all the web pages or you will generate that content dynamically You will generate that content dynamically I will take Google's example If I search for a Hary by You can see that the header of Google is this link This format doesn't change If I click here Shubham I have written Shubham I will write like Shubham When I wrote Hary by Google is showing similar content What Google does? Google's server The backend Processes the backend to send the HTML corresponding to the HTML Shubham When Hary by So this To generate this The backend is being processed Now this backend can be joined This can be a flash This can be a node This can be a PHP This can be a Ruby on Rails And the database used in the backend The client who does the backend does not see the client This is the server that sends the server How did the server make this code? We don't know Because it is running on the server If you are confused You will understand The backend will come Now we understand The HTML, CSS and JavaScript These three languages If you are making a website If you are making a website If you are making a website If you are making a website If you are using only HTML Then it becomes a very basic Scal<|ar|> You can style it You can see the button on the card You can see the button on the card This is the CSS size You can see the edges This is the CSS size So CSS work To style a page What color will be the color of this button? What will be the color of this button? This is a beauty The CSS is the HTML page The HTML is the most basic It is a body Some people understand that this is a standard If you make any website You have to parse it It is a part of the HTML And HTML is a standard It is a standard It is a standard It will be made in this world It will be made in HTML It is a standard So that everyone Make the same pages If you are making any browser You have to parse the same language If you have learned 80% HTML Then you are good to go for web development If you write HTML code If you write HTML code Then write HTML code I am writing HTML code I used HTML code Like I have used the image of the animation You can use the image of the image Like I have written this And I can use HTML file It is a good thing And as I open the file You can see This will be open I can open this directly It is completely open and has been written as HTML. But it is not styled as well. It is very basic HTML file. You can directly run videos with HTML file. I have HTML file and I will show you the videos you can run with. I work to show you the HTML file you can change the file. We can see the videos in such a way. So, in HTML there is a video tag. If you hit the video enter, the video will play in the SRC. Like I used to do video 1.10 before. You can see the video is automatically shown in VSCode. This file is used in VSCode. You can see here that I will reload it. I can play it automatically here. To play, I have to click on Control. I will refresh it. I will play it. This is a magic. It is very important to make a video. It needs a case. A 103-rowed Mahangara Final. I will add video 2.m. I added video 1. I have 2 more videos. I have some more videos. I will refer them to video 2.m. I will show you the video 2. What you have done? I have put the bench sticks. Now, I will do the same. What do you do? I will play the video 3. I will reload it. I have put the 3.m. I will close it. I can also do video 4. I have a DJ video. DJ is the DJ. DJ is the DJ. DJ is the DJ. DJ is the DJ. DJ is the DJ. DJ is the DJ. You can make this video. You don't need to do anything else. You can play video games. You can play all of it. If you want to style it, You can add a board. You can use CSS to add a board. CSS adds beauty to a website. Javascript is added to the website. For example, What will be the code with Harry? The code with Harry is written, The code with Harry is written, The code with Harry is written, The code with Harry is written, The code with Harry is written, So all these things are from Java script. We call it client side scripting. We want to do scripting here. We can do it on the client side. This is the brain of Java script. So we have to do it on our website. Beauty with Brain. I am talking about the website. Beauty with Brain. And Brain from Java script. Now, Java script helps you to make a dynamic page. If you want to change the content of the page, it is from Java script. If you are coming here, I will kill all these people. Oh my God, they are not doing anything here. I am working on my record. Oh my God. I like video because I eat crores for you. When I was in college, I had a spoon. I went to HTML, CSS, Java script, and learnt it. I learnt it 100% and I learnt it 100%. Until I remember all the properties. But this brain is wrong. HTML is only 80%. And CSS is only 40% and Java script is only 50% to 70%. We can start web development. We can make projects and make them. We can grow from there. Next, in this course, I will tell you about chat GPD and web development. We will do it. You should be Tune. So, don't forget to take HTML and CSS. I will do it for a year and I will do it for the next year. I will do it for the next year and I will do it for the next 4 years. Never think about it. HTML, C, CSS, CSS, CSS, etc. And the JavaScript, which is 50% to 70%, you can make a big website. And as soon as you make a website, you will experience more HTML and CSS. And you will learn more about JavaScript. And you will not even know that you have done the HTML and CSS. You will be making money and working as a professional web developer. So, you will be learning with your own skills. And you will be making your skills with your own skills. So, I will think that I will make all HTML tags on the web site. I will make all CSS properties on the web site. I will make all JavaScript websites on the web site. I will teach you so much. I will only teach you that. You will learn what matters. And I don't want you to learn only for a year. So, I designed this course with this course. So, you will learn only that thing that matters. And the rest of the things you will learn from the practice. So, I will teach you a lot of practice in this course. Here, Sigma web development course has been taught for 2-4 years. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course, we will learn HTML and CSS. We will learn JavaScript and CSS. And I will teach you this course in this course. Because you will not hear anything. And I will teach you a lot of points in this course. I will teach you a course here. I have learned a lot of great tips in my career. And I want you to learn all the tricks. If you have any doubts in the course. Then you can use the hashtag doubt. And you can use the hashtag doubt. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try my best. I will try to solve all the doubts. So, if you have any questions, ask them. You need to write a hashtag doubt. And please write comments in the comments. And don't write them in the hashtag doubt. So that I can do the comments that I will write. I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can. And you will get everything in this course. So, if you haven't done this course yet. That will bring a smile on my face. Now, what is this react? What is next? What is Angular? See, all these things that you can use in the JavaScript. So, HTML and CSS are made from the JavaScript. We will help you to process this process. How? We will learn in this course. Yes, we will learn in this course. We will learn in this course. I told you that I will make a different course. I will make you this way that you will get a web development in the web development. You can use it as a signature web development express. A good analogy is that you want to give HTML and CSS to the JavaScript. HTML is just like car skeleton. Because of that, CSS and internal engine car is in it. So, it is JavaScript. Look at the example of a human being. The skeleton is HTML. After that, the skin is all mixed up. So, CSS and brain is all mixed up. The nervous system of this technique is JavaScript. Now, I will take you to Forbes.com. You will see that you have opened a website here. And Forbes.com is a website that uses HTML and CSS in JavaScript. It is just like another website. Now, if I click on right click on inspect. Here, the inspect element is opened. Now, look here. You have used the head in the script. And here, to add CSS, they have used the link. So, what I will do here is that CSS is removed from here. So, I will simply remove CSS. All the style tags and all the clear tags. I will use it as a delete. So, I will remove all the style tags. And with this, I will remove all the link tags. So, as I have deleted all the styles of this page, I will show this page in this way. They have only got raw HTML. What size they want to get? How they want to get all the images? And I have just taken raw HTML here. The style that they have not done yet is Forbes.com. It has been made up of some kind of HTML. And it has only been shown raw buttons. It has raw text. It has raw links. And similarly, I will remove the script tags and see how it will look. Now, if I delete this HTML tag from here, I have deleted it from here. I have deleted it from here. So, it has become a blank page. So, this is not the HTML tag. So, this is the HTML CSS. I will make a script to make a web page. I will make this course initially made to be paid. But I have changed my mood and converted it into free course. I thought I will put it on YouTube. So, I want you all to be serious. I have also launched this course to launch a paid course. But I should have given it a free course. Because when I learn web development, I can understand. When you have a course not to learn it, And you don't have an affordability to do a paid course. So, I can understand and I have decided that I have launched a single web development course. This course is free. But it is free. As you will earn money in the coming days. You all will be able to earn money in the coming days. This is our agreement in this video. So, when you earn a road and you earn a lot of money, Then you will be able to sell a house. But you will be able to do it. When you earn a good amount, Only after you start earning good. So, I will tell you in the next video How you can earn money in this way. You will be able to complete this course. This is also important. How you can earn money? That is also important personally. I will be freelancing like this. I will tell you all about this course. I want to tell you some action items. First action item is to access this course playlist. I will give you all the books. You can download the start button and then start it. You can also save the book. Now, the course paid is also important. Thank you so much for all the support. All the support that you give me. I will show you the best. But this course is going to be free. Now, there are no technical issues. I am putting all these videos in 1080p. I am putting them in resolution. So, you should be very clear about it. But, they say that the SD model is video 240p 144p. You can see the quality of the mobile phone. You can see the quality of the mobile phone. And I am telling you that this video is not going to be recorded. Someone called me to read this. So, I hope that you all will understand this video. What is the response? How do you get all these websites? I have found a basic idea. How is the client's server interaction? In the coming videos, we will see how the website is made. We will make our first website in the next video. So, we should make a lot of people excited about it. In the next video, our first website is going to be made. And you can also get it in the next video. It is the first website. So, please access it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
