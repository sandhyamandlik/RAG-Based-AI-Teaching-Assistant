You can write it in the web page We talked about basic structure We said that it is HTML HTML Lang is equal to EN It is the value of the attribute of the language In English, this is the content This is the search engine If any of the link of this web page is in the description You can parse the web page from the search engine You can also find out that your web page is in English Here is the header, which is the metadata, which is the title, which is the link of CSS It is the information of the body Now, it is the tag to put the body in the header I will write in the description box If I write in the description box, we will write H1 tags If I want to live here I will click here Then I will browser it I will show you how to use my bookmarks Now, why should I use H1 in my bookmark? I didn't write directly in my bookmark Because I will tell you the browser This is my first heading Now, I will use H2 I will use H2 in my bookmark I will use H2 in my bookmark I will use H2 in my bookmark I will use H2 in my bookmark If you have used Microsoft Word, you will know what H1H2 is I will tell you the main level of the writing And the second level of the writing is H2 I mean, I will use the main bookmarks And I will use the main bookmarks I will use it in the box I will use the main bookmark But, not on screen If you want to know that you press Alt, then click on the button where you will be able to use it. As you know, I will click on the right side and then just click on the right side. But click on Alt, then you will be able to use it. As you know, I want to use all the bookmarks in the code. So, I want to use my bookmarks dash code. I can write something like this. I have not written this, then click on Alt, then click on Alt, then click on Alt, then I will get multiple cut sets. I will type whatever I want, I will get multiple cut sets. I will type whatever I want, I will get it. Let me like it. So, I will remove some of these things here, and you will see that this is my main heading. This is my H2. This is my H1H2. We have H6th heading. You can say that you have given the main heading. You have given the main heading. Then you have to give any heading after that. And so on. You have to give a lot of subheadings. You can give the H6th heading. H6th is more than enough. You can use H7th in HTML. You will never have to give the H7th heading. You will never have to give the H7th heading. And if you have given the H6th heading, you can use it repeatedly. Because it is so small that you will have to give a small amount of H6th. So, you will have to give a small amount of H6th. Now, I will do Alt shift down. I will replicate it. And I will click Alt, then I will type Alt. These are all the short cuts. So that you guys have a lot of productivity. Now, I have put two cut sets here and here. I will type Backspace, then I will type Alt, then I will type Alt, then I will type H4. And I will type H5 here. Now I will type H6th here. So, H6th is the same. Now, I will write here using H1. So that you guys know. I will write here using. I will type Space, I will type H. And now, I will type H2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And you see something like this. So, you will know that I have done H1 like this. It is H2 like this. It is H3, it is H4, it is H5, it is H6. And what is the small amount of H6th? This will end in a short time. So, H6 is more than enough. So, I will show you a practical demonstration. I have told you that my HTML tutorial is here. I have given the main adding, HTML introduction. Then I have given you the word HTML. Then I have given you the features of HTML. I have given it from H1, this is from H2. I have given it from H3, and it is from H2. I have given it from H3, and it is from H2. Here, Y in the term, hypertext and markup language, it is heading to. What is the main adding? HTML introduction. And then, all these are the settings. I have given you the word HTML, and I have used it from H3. Then, I have come to H2, because it was from H2. So, the H1, H1, H2, H4, H5, H6, is the most important. Okay, I hope you guys understood.
