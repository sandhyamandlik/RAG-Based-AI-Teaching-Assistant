Now we will talk about how to use Open-Tax, Loosing, Text, Structure, and Website. So here, I will make a new folder called Video3 and open it with the Open-Vit code. And you guys can see that my theme is blue color. And many people said that blue is not good. Look, the theme is the choice of your choice. If you want to change the color theme, you can change the color theme. I can use the dark color of the grid up. And I can use the dark color of the grid up. I will add an index.html to make a new file. We already talked about this. Here, if I write the title of the page and content here. Then I will use the link tag and then use the MET and link the style.css. That's why I am already talking about this in the previous video. Now, if I write the script.js here and then I will write alert from the alert. So I will not tell you the exact same thing. Here, if I put a script tag here and then just before the body. And then, I will write script.css here and then write script.js. And here, click here and then open with browser. So this will come and if I write the background of the body here, then it will be red. I will not tell you all this. Because I have already told you guys. Now, I will tell you that what is this structure? Why did you write so much? This is a doubt. We can write the title and the content directly. So much to write. So I will tell you how much to write. I will reload it. Look, the content here is here and this is red. Now, you will see that I need to reload the page. People will ask me why to reload the page. When I reload the page already. So, look, I changed the CSS file. When I change CSS file, I will need to reload at times. If you are using HTML file, you are changing it. You will not need to reload the HTML file changes. Now, here, I will do something. I will come back and explain to you. This is a basic structure. We write HTML website first. We write doc type HTML. Then write HTML tag. Look, HTML tag is opening tag or closing tag. This is the opening tag of the body. This is the closing tag. This is the head opening tag or closing tag. This is the head content of the body. What is the head content of the HTML? The title content of the body is the title content. Now, what is the content of the meta? The meta is a self closing tag. There are two types of tags in HTML. One is self closing tag. And the other is the pair tag. What is the pair tag? The opening tag is the closing tag. This is the basic structure of the HTML website.

Now, it is not only the purpose of this, you can see the title here. The search engines use it. The search engines are Google and you can find code with Harry HTML. So, code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working, all the titles are put in the page. You can see here, the HTML introduction is the title of the page.
